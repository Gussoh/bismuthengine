The purpose of the engine we call "The Bismuth Engine", or simply TBE, is to facilitate the needs of an adventure game. Adventure games we had in mind during writing the specifications were games such as Monkey Island from 1990 and the Swedish game "Safecracker" from 1997. The example game we are thinking about is similar to safecracker where you are trying to get into a building. To do this you have to get by a sequence of locks on different doors. Going from very easy in the beginning to more and more difficult puzzle like locks.

But we did an FPS instead. Its under download. Enjoy!

You need the DirectX 9 runtime, otherwise you'll get funny dll-errors.
